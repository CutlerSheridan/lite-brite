# Things left to do

## TO-DO

- specify order for wrapping control bar
- figure out what to do with clear button on focus

### (maybe do)
- make credit placement responsive (add listener so every time window is resized it calculates where to put it?)
- warn before cropping image
- make mobile-friendly
- add sounds for inserting pegs and/or turning light off/on

### (probably not do)
- optimize light toggle // maybe this is done?
- put transition back in? make peg-hole transition only when light is turned on or off? much faster without it so maybe not
- make each pass over the same peg brighter?  like add x% each time
- add something so the lights go off for a moment before getting taken out completely

## COMPLETED

- ~~make text smaller for switch and slider~~
- ~~align left button group and right button group~~
- ~~change fonts~~
- ~~ add separate "todo" file~~
- ~~make the size of the pegs variable based on the number~~
- ~~fix light switch so turning it off before placing any pegs works~~
- ~~specify grid size (up to 100?) and keep art~~
- ~~make sure grid resizing isn't cutting off the far right edge~~
- ~~change to specific color~~
- ~~change to random color~~
- ~~clear pegs~~
- ~~turn light on/off~~
- ~~color picker doesn't end party~~
